# TwitterLight

Watches a Twitter stream for hashtags and adjusts a light from hot (red) to blue (cool) depending on the difference between the near term frequency of this term versus its long term frequency. One of my favorite demos of a Nitrogen application.

## Nitrogen Project

1. [service](https://github.com/nitrogenjs/service): Core platform responsible for managing principals, security, and messaging.
2. [client](https://github.com/nitrogenjs/client): JavaScript client library for building Nitrogen devices and applications.
3. [admin](https://github.com/nitrogenjs/admin): Administrative tool for managing the Nitrogen service.
4. [device](https://github.com/nitrogenjs/devices): Adaptors for common pieces of hardware.
5. [commands](https://github.com/nitrogenjs/commands): CommandManagers and schemas for well known command types.
6. [cli](https://github.com/nitrogenjs/cli): Command line interface for working with a Nitrogen service.
